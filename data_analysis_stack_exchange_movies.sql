At the end of the movie, Leamas is let out of his cell by Mundt and provided with a car.  Mundt also lets Leamas\' lover, Nan, escape with him.  Mundt knows, however, that Leamas is ;ing to tell Nan everything, which is why he has the boy shoot her as she and Leamas are climbing over the wall.  When Leamas sees that Nan has been shot, he decides that he doesn\'t want to ; on living without her, climbs back to the East German side, and gets shot.</p>\n\n<p>Why was Nan released in the first place, however?  Leamas seems to believe, in his final monologue, that it was part of a deal, and that Mundt believed that he wouldn\'t leave without her, a belief that is justified in the last minute of the film.  But it seems to me that Leamas would be more likely to accept life as a Nan-less spy if she was ditched in East Germany than if she was shot by a fellow British agent.

The Soviets will easily believe that Fiedler\'s co-conspirators helped Leamas escape, because Leamas was working for them and they owed it to him, and the official explanation is that Leamas and Fiedler were working together to incriminate Mundt, so it makes sense that Fiedler\'s friends would help him escape.  What makes less sense, however, is Fiedler\'s friends helping Nan escape - they owe nothing to her, and Nan was the girl who unraveled their entire plot.

In a somewhat unorthodox fashion, however, many of the original actors/actresses that Andy crossed paths with were called back to assist with the re-creation of those very same scenes. </p>\n\n<p>So, aside from the obvious amount of time that has passed (the actors and actresses clearly all look a bit older) the scenes are more-or-less exact replicas of what happened in Andy\'s past. This includes many cameos from the cast of Taxi, wrestler Jerry Lawler, SNL Producer Lorne Michaels, David Letterman and more. There are most certainly some actors that weren\'t able to reprise their roles, for various reasons (the scene wasn\'t important enough, the original actor wasn\'t available/dead/etc), but there was one key actor missing who could have reprised his role--for a very significant scene: Michael Richards, in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_xqiCeIFws\">the \"Friday\'s\" incident</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Back in \'81, Andy appeared on a live sketch comedy show which attempted to take advantage of the success of Saturday Night Live. It was comprised of young comedians getting their start in the industry, and performing sketches on live TV, much in the same fashion as SNL. On one particular night, a sketch involving four friends (one of which was played by Andy Kaufman, another by Michael Richards) took place at a restaurant, with the joke being that they would get up at various times and head to the bathroom to smoke marijuana. About half-way through this sketch, Kaufman decided for whatever reason to ; off script, infuriating and frustrating his fellow cast members. At one point, Richards ;es off camera and returns with the sketch\'s cue cards, and tosses them on the table in front of Kaufman, at which point Kaufman sprays Richards with a glass of water, causing even more friction, and an eventual fight breaks out between Kaufman and Friday\'s co-producer Jack Burns.</p>\n\n<p>Andy was known for unconventional humor. Throughout his career, he made a lot of judgment calls about what he thought was true comedy, but that not very many other people seemed to agree on. One recurring theme in his comedy was that <strong>he liked to keep the audience guessing</strong>. Was what we were seeing really real? Or was it all an elaborate hoax? A staged event that really truly seems like it is actually happening, only to find out later that it was a sham from the start. </p>\n\n<p>Many people that Kaufman staged these \"events\" with now confirm today that they were, in fact, staged; the most famous of which could be considered the entire series of events that took place between wrestler Jerry Lawler and Kaufman. And, as expected, in the case of the \"Friday\'s\" incident, it was also revealed later that the entire scene...Kaufman ;ing off script, Richards\' frustration, the cue-cards, the water splashing and eventual fight...all was a plan from the beginning. Richards himself confirms this in an episode of <a href=\"http://archive.firstamendmentcenter.org/about.aspx?id=12083\">\"Speaking Freely\"</a> (<a href=\"http://archive.firstamendmentcenter.org/flash/display_video.aspx?id=20695\">Video</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Even though people confirm that these Kaufman-events were planned from the start, one very real fact remains: out of all of the actors/actresses that ever had the luxury of coming into contact and dealing with Kaufman, and were given the opportunity to return and pay homage to Andy by recreating those same scenes in the \"Man on the Moon\" film, one person refused: <em>Michael Richards</em>. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>The question is, why?</strong></p>\n\n<p>If, like so many other actors, Richards had truly been \"in\" on the event from the start, then shouldn\'t he, as a comedian, understand the value of that comedic genius and want to pay homage to it like others? Or was there another reason that kept Richards from participating, other than the most basic guesses of <em>\"it was an embarrassment for him\"</em>, or <em>\"he simply didn\'t want to re-live the past\"</em>, or even <em>\"his schedule simply didn\'t allow for him to contribute to the movie\"</em> (which seems unlikely). </p>\n\n<p>Is there any proof available to the story that the event, though portrayed after the fact as a hoax, may have truly been, in fact, something that Kaufman came up with on-the-fly, and the network/people involved simply used \"oh, it was planned\" as a cover for them losing control of Kaufman on live TV--and that the <em>real</em> reason Richards refused to portray himself in that infamous scene was due to the fact that <strong>he knew the truth</strong>...that Kaufman embarrassed Richards and his fellow cast members on live TV without their knowledge, and to this day, will really have nothing to do with any homage paying tribute to Kaufman? </p>', 165, 1199, '2013-07-02 11:43:08', '2013-07-02 11:43:08', 'Why did Michael Richards refuse to portray himself?', '<analysis><comedy><cinema-history><man-on-the-moon>', '2012-03-07 20:10:53');

It seems loosely that cast (in order of today\'s \"big name\" significance), directors and financiers get the front spots, and everything else appears later.  But lately I\'ve been developing some specific curiosities about how cast members are credited on TV shows.</p>\n\n<p>Opening credits seem to follow this rough outline:</p>\n\n<p>Part of \"opening credits\" video segment</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>(optional) Major Actors</li>\n<li>Show Title</li>\n<li>Core Cast Actors</li>\n<li>Directors</li>\n<li>Producers</li>\n<li>(optional) Episode Title</li>\n<li>Episode Writers</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Subtitles over beginning of show, after opening video</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>(Episode Title and Writers may appear here, instead)</li>\n<li>Special Guest Actors</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I\'ve probably missed a few things, and mis-ordered a few things.  But, as I said, my main curiosity is about actor credits.</p>\n\n<p>Typically, there is little indication of which characters the core cast actors play.  Sometimes their name is edited to appear along with an image of the character as an indictator, but sometimes there is no indication.  As I\'ve never seen anyone credited in both the opening and closing credits, that leaves the potential for core actors to never be directly associated with their character.  This seems potentially problematic; is there a reason for this?  Are viewers expected to know who\'s who?</p>\n\n<p>Guest actors sometimes are simply credited by name (and not being part of the opening video, this means they will never be associated with their character in credits).  But often they are credited as \"<strong>special guest</strong> as <strong>character name</strong>\".  This is quite helpful.</p>\n\n<p>The thing I find really confusing is, sometimes the last few regular cast actors will get the guest actor treatment.  I\'ve seen opening video with \"and <strong>actor</strong> as <strong>character</strong>\" paired with an image of that character for an entire season.  Why does this actor get special treatment?</p>\n\n<p>Finally, sometimes guest actors will be credited at the front following the opening video, sometimes they\'ll be credited in the closing credits.  Are there rules for deciding who get\'s credited early or late?</p>\n\n<p>I\'ve sometimes wondered if shows deliberately play with actor\'s name position to obfuscate plot arcs (\"you won\'t think we\'re killing of this character if their actor is still in the opening credits\", or \"you won\'t expect this recurring guest if we place their name in the closing credits\") and I\'ve also wondered if there are thresholds for \"people appearing in XX number or YY percentage of episodes get placed <strong>here</strong>.\"  But it\'s difficult to build a ;od sampling base for this.  And season 7 of Stargate SG-1 kinda took a shotgun to my guesses so far.</p>\n\n<p>So...

He warns the upcoming SWAT team that the grenade will ; off shortly and they run away.</p>\n\n<p>This question states that the policemen didn\'t have enough time to escape the explosion. But I for myself always thought they made it out of the explosion radius in time, but then again, I\'m not totally sure about this anymore, since this question says they surely didn\'t have enough time as judged by the immediate cut to the explosion destroying the building (although I vaguely remember it to only destroy a single floor).</p>\n\n<p>The reason I\'m asking this is, that I think the fact of the policemen dying would bring a major inconsistency with the general moral justification of the heroes\' actions throughout the movie. There are actually no real human enemies in this movie and the movie more than one time elaborates on the fact, that the heroes (and especially the supposedly ;od <em>Terminator</em>) don\'t kill anyone, in order for the viewer to better identify with them on a moral basis. Whereas the previous movie had that touch of sweet immorality, once you decided that it is <em>cool</em> to watch <em>Arnie</em> run around and kill everybody, this one ;es to great lengths to show him as a <em>\";od guy\"</em>, especially in the scene more or less immediately before the questioned one. And in the end most action movies where the hero kills multiple bad guys in a row still try not to show him directly killing innocents.</p>\n\n<p>So I see different possibilities for this:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The SWAT team didn\'t die and managed to escape in time.</li>\n<li>Their death is to be justified as kind of collateral damage (in line with all the others killed by the <em>T-1000</em>, the \"evil <em>Terminator</em>\"), since <em>Dyson</em> didn\'t kill them completely on purpose.</li>\n<li>Their death is merely ignored or justified with a sense of \"the end justifies the means\" (which IMHO wouldn\'t be in line with the movie\'s previous moral elaborations, though).</li>\n<li>It is left open for the viewer to decide (which in turn was a bit too <em>\"heavy\"</em> an aspect for such a straight-to-the-point action movie).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And my question is, <strong>did the SWAT team die from <em>Miles Dyson</em>\'s grenade, and if yes, how is this supposed to be justified?</strong></p>\n\n<p>(disclaimer: Now it might be that this has been intentionally left open for interpretation which would make this a bit of an open discussion question. But I might also just have overlooked something (or not remebering it that well) or there is even an official statement about this from the writers.)</p>', 1478, 1683, '2013-02-05 16:07:45', '2014-04-12 23:30:13', 'Did Miles Dyson kill all these policemen?', '<plot-explanation><analysis><terminator-2>', '2013-02-23 18:48:20');

It seems entirely plausible Marla Singer materializes to remind Jack he is exploiting these therapy groups. In fact, even when Marla enters she says, \"This is cancer, right?\" nobody responds.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the blog, there are three examples of where I can think Marla Singer\'s presence is suggested but not required.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>After Tyler\'s confrontation to Marla, he follows her to the laundromat where she removes the clothes from the dryer and proceeds next-door to sell them at a thrift shop. Even though the two are having a conversation in front of the thrift-shop attendant, she does not interject and instead only remains silent with a puzzled look on her face about the talk of bowel cancer. </p>\n\n<p>Does this suggest that overly-civilized and feminized Jack invents Marla, a symbol of his guilt, and steers her toward outlet for his disdain of the order of society? Marla is self-destructive, manipulative, and a kleptomaniac. Whereas later on, Jack invents a hyper-masculine Tyler who is outwardly destructive, blatantly honest and disdains materialism and thus has no need to steal.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>After Jack\'s boss finds some Fight Club paraphernalia on the Xerox machine, Jack says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I\'d be very careful who I talked to about this.  It sounds like someone dangerous wrote it... someone who might snap at any moment, stalking from office to office with an Armalite AR-10 Carbine-gas semiautomatic, bitterly pumping round after round into colleagues and co-workers. Might be someone you\'ve known for years... somebody very close to you. Or, maybe you shouldn\'t be bringing me every little piece of trash you pick up.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Then the phone rings, and it\'s Marla. Since we already know Jack invents Tyler as a way for him to cope with his repression from civilization, it seems like picking up the phone and talking to an imaginary person would use the same set of coping skills that led him to invent Tyler. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>In the diner after not having seen Marla for an extended period of time, she orders food: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"I\'ll have the clam chowder, the fried chicken with the baked potato with everything, and a chocolate chiffon pie.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If Marla isn\'t real, the waiter only responds to Jack\'s subsequent request for <em>Clean food, please.</em>, by saying,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In that case, sir, may I advise against the lady eating the clam chowder?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We know the clam chowder at any of the restaurants is arguably the most contaminated food item. So, it would be logical for the waiter to recommend not eating clam chowder to anybody requesting clean food.</p>\n\n<p>There are many possibilities as to why the waiter says the \"<strong>lady</strong>\" but it seems like this is the most damning to the theory of Marla\'s non-existence. The waiter may be attempting to allude to the fact that Jack isn\'t the same person as he is during Fight Club. But it may not be as bad as it seems at first glance, because the waiter doesn\'t use the pronoun <strong>she</strong> or <strong>her</strong>. </p>\n\n<p>It is also acceptable to refer to a high-ranking woman to their face as \"<em>the lady</em>\".</p>\n\n<p>Since Jack even thought to himself --</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Even if I could tell someone they had a ;od fight, I wouldn\'t be talking to the same man. Who you were in fight club is not who you were in the rest of the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Perhaps this is a play on Jack\'s lack of masculinity outside of Fight Club, the same way drill sergeants call their recruits ladies. After all, Jack does not want to be a celebrity, he wants to be one of the masses along with his followers.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Is there any more evidence or counter evidence to the claim?</p>', 291, 220, '2013-03-11 18:43:44', '2014-09-05 20:50:08', 'In Fight Club is Marla Singer a second figment of Jack\'s imagination?', '<plot-explanation><character><fight-club>', '2013-03-30 16:53:45');

It sticks out so starkly, I can\'t help but feel that it was intentional, for effect.</p>\n\n<p>When I saw it in theaters, I initially thought it was perhaps an allusion to the \"spirit\" of Ra\'s speaking through Bane, or similarly, that perhaps it was the League of Shadows as a whole -- a legion of spirits speaking through the League of Shadows-\"incarnate\".</p>\n\n<p>After the movie, when discovering that others hadn\'t heard or noticed it, I wondered if it was just coincidental, or perhaps just some fluctuation or mismatch of Bane\'s voice processing in post-production.</p>\n\n<p><em>Where it is:</em></p>\n\n<p>In the underground sewer scene, when Bane and Batman are fighting, listen to Bane\'s lines right after Batman throws the smoke bombs in front of Bane.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>BANE: \"Theatricality and deception, powerful agents to the uninitiated.\"  </p>\n  \n  <p>BANE: \"...But we are initiated, aren\'t we, Bruce?\"</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>BANE (voice change): \"<em>Members</em> of the League of Shadows. And you betrayed <em>us</em>.\"*</strong>  (emphasis mine)</p>\n  \n  <p>BATMAN: \"...\"<strong><em>Us</em></strong>\"? <strong><em>You</em></strong> were excommunicated... by a gang of psychopaths.\" (*See EDIT)</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>BANE: \"I am the League of Shadows...\"</strong> (switches to normal voice) \"And I\'m here to fulfill Ra\'s Al Ghul\'s destiny!\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>++ The YouTube clip is no longer available ++</p>\n\n<p>It sounds so distinct to me, it sounds like a different actor\'s voice entirely. </p>\n\n<p>Batman calls out Bane on his \"altered\"-voice statement where Bane infers that he\'s still in full fellowship with the League of Shadows. This could lend credence to Bane actually changing his voice as if it were the League speaking through him, like a legion, or as a spokesperson. </p>\n\n<p>This <em>could</em> be an intentional alteration by Bane himself, or it could perhaps be an \"audience-only\" subtext or view -- subtly foreshadowing the coming resurgence and \"reincarnation\" of the League of Shadows through both Ra\'s\' appearance and Talia\'s (eventual) unmasking.</p>\n\n<p>It definitely doesn\'t sound like Ra\'s\' voice (Liam Neeson), though, which could\'ve made plausible sense (plot-wise) as a foreshadowing or reminder of Ra\'s\' \"eternal\" nature. Although this voice change could similarly be alluding or foreshadowing to a wider scale of the League of Shadows as a whole (if intentional, of course).</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:</p>\n\n<p>After rereading and rewatching the scene, it\'s now my opinion that the voice change here very likely <em>is</em> intentional, whether in a \"conscious\" or \"subconscious\" theatrical vein. </p>\n\n<p>I lean toward it being a subtle, subconscious form of directorial foreshadowing, where it\'s not intended for the audience to be consciously aware of or focused on it -- much like the similar \"subconscious\" foreshadowing of when we first see Miranda and Bruce meet (at the charity ball) -- </p>\n\n<p>Miranda enters the scene covering her face with a masquerade mask (alluding/foreshadowing her deception as \"Talia\"), as Bruce asks her, \"Miss Tate, ...isn\'t it?\" (she doesn\'t answer him, only puts down the mask):</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/yIJjV.jpg\" alt=\"Talia\'s Foreshadowing\"></p>\n\n<p>What makes Bane\'s voice change seem too unlikely to be coincidental is that the pairing of the voice change coincides with the <em>precise</em> instance of his dialog where he no longer refers to himself as a <em>singular</em> individual, but rather, as <em>multiple</em> people, a group -- </p>\n\n<p>\"<strong><em>Members</em></strong> of the League of Shadows.... you betrayed <strong><em>us</em></strong>\"</p>\n\n<p>And even Batman doesn\'t let this slip past unnoticed, calling Bane out on it -- </p>\n\n<p>\"...\'<strong><em>Us</em></strong>\'? <strong><em>You</em></strong> were excommunicated...\" </p>\n\n<p>...Which Bane then responds by reversing his reference of himself as a singular individual rather than many -- while also coinciding with the \"altered\" voice suddenly disappearing into the shadows.</p>\n\n<p>Hence, I think I\'ll put my money on this being a subtle, \"unconscious\" foreshadowing for the audience that the League of Shadows is still alive, that it\'s <em>not</em> just Bane acting solo.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, I\'m ;ing to try to reach out to someone involved in the production process, in the hopes of shedding some definitive light on this -- (just for fun, of course) :) I\'ll post back any information.</p>', 1391, 1182, '2014-03-25 20:32:31', '2014-03-25 20:32:31', 'Does Bane\'s voice change in this scene because of plot?', '<analysis><dark-knight-rises>', '2013-05-06 18:50:47');

He follows what he believes to be a \'clue\' in Borden\'s notebook and travels to Colorado to meet Nikola Tesla, who Angiers believes can build a machine that can help him perform the trick. Angier believes that Tesla built a similar machine for Borden. However, the final pages of the notebook reveal that Tesla was merely a red herring, designed to get Angier out of Borden\'s way for a long time. Tesla, it turns out, had never built such a machine before.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, Tesla agrees to build Angier\'s machine anyway. Instead of building a machine that transports matter, he builds one that duplicates it. Angier uses this machine in his act, but in order to avoid multiple Angier clones cluttering up the place, one of them has to die as part of the act.</p>\n\n<p>This all makes sense, so far, but I don\'t buy the idea that Borden\'s use of the word \'Tesla\' as the key to his cipher is random. It\'s too coincidental that he sends Angiers on a wild ;ose chase, but Angiers returns with a working machine. A film such as this one shouldn\'t have to rely on a wild coincidence to move the narrative forward, so there must be something else ;ing on.</p>\n\n<p>Is there any evidence that Borden cloned himself using Tesla\'s machine?</p>', 1076, 1634, '2013-07-07 13:41:32', '2014-08-03 23:30:30', 'Is Borden\'s true identity real, or another ruse?', '<plot-explanation><the-prestige>', '2013-07-15 13:16:01');

They only attack military targets, either when provoked or when it\'s necessary to further their objective.</li>\n<li>The camera is very quick to cut away when it appears that a defenceless target is being attacked, meaning the audience never gets to see what happened.</li>\n<li>Every violent act committed by the aliens is in response to aggression from the humans. (In response to a comment, I\'ll concede that firing into traffic at Pearl Harbor is a hostile act. However, by the time this happens, the humans have already escalated hostilities, so it\'s not like it was completely unprovoked).</li>\n<li>The prota;nist constantly makes mistakes and escalates hostilities at every opportunity. He actually botches the entire first contact mission, starts a war, gets huge numbers of innocent people killed, and also kills all of the aliens. At the end he is lauded as a hero despite all this.

Now I also see that most questions were answered, even though some questions are still left for debate.</p>\n\n<p>One question that I do wish the producers had given a more satisfactory answer to, though, is the connection between Eloise Hawking and MIB\'s loophole.  When Locke leaves the island, he is told by Christian Shephard (i.e. MIB), to find Eloise Hawking in Los Angeles.  Eloise is then later paramount in ensuring that the loophole works in that she is insisting that the coffin with Locke\'s body must be on board the Ajira-flight, thus providing MIB with his \"vessel\" for completing the loophole.  These two facts made me think that perhaps Eloise somehow was cooperating with MIB, but this is never really confirmed, and since we know that MIB can not leave the island, this means that MIB must have \"recruited\" Eloise before she left the island. But if this is the case, how could MIB know about his loophole-plan years before it manifested?  Does MIB perhaps have contact with somebody else off the island who could relay information to Eloise?  Or is it perhaps possible that Eloise really had no contact with MIB, and simply insisted Locke\'s body had to be on the Ajira-flight in order to have a \"substitue\" for Christian Shephard\'s body which was on Oceanic 815?  Or was she somehow manipulated by MIB without her knowledge through some way never seen on the show?  </p>\n\n<p>I really do not find a satisfactory answer to this, so I would love to hear some theories from other people here!  </p>', 350, 692, '2013-08-14 17:38:36', '2013-08-14 17:38:36', 'Eloise Hawking\'s connection to MIB and the loophole', '<plot-explanation><lost>', '2013-09-28 12:21:55');

But given that we already had <a href=\"http://movies.stackexchange.com/questions/2268/why-was-the-avengers-movie-called-something-different-in-the-uk\">previous instances of seemingly arbitrary title changes</a> that garnered pretty definite and ;od answers in the end, there might in fact be a known reason behind this oddity. <strong>So why was the title of this movie changed in such a minor yet unreasonable way for the German version?</strong></p>', 5, 1503, '2013-09-18 08:00:29', '2014-05-09 21:00:23', 'Why was the title changed to Dark Kingdom in the German release?', '<title><thor-the-dark-world>', '2013-09-15 15:44:35');
